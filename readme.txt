http://royale.zerezo.com/psp/

Install:
	* Copy PSP-Maps folder to your PSP/GAME3xx folder.
	* For custom firmwares 3.90, please also try PSP/GAME380 folder.

Controls:
	* Digital pad: move the map.
	* Analog pad: move smoothly the map.
	* R button: zoom in.
	* L button: zoom out.
	* >< button: next view.
	* [] button: previous view.
	* /\ button: go to address.
	* () button: show/hide informations.
	* Start: menu.

Offline browsing:
	* First, make sure the disk cache is enabled (default).
	* Then, when you are online, browse the map to fill your cache.
	* When you start PSP-Maps, you can skip the wireless menu.
	* Now, you can browse your cache!

Caching:
	* You can adjust the size of your cache in the menu (you must validate to confirm).
	* The bigger is the better, but it will use some space on your memory stick.
	* The "cache neighborhood" option is helpful to download a big map to your cache.

PC version:
	* If you don't have WiFi, you can use the PC version to build a compatible cache.
	* It can also be used to prepare a large cache (PC is faster than PSP).
	* You will have exactly the same display as the PSP.
	* Arrows to move, page up/down to zoom, F1/F2/F3/F4 for buttons, escape for menu.
	* Copy the data/ folder to your PSP.

GP2X version:
	* You will have to build a map cache on the PC before.
	* This is just experimental, it may not work in the future...
